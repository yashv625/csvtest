CSVTest is a test data generator which produces CSV data suitable for use in relational database applications. To use CSVTest, you write XML scripts describing your data and then run these through CSVTest, which is a Windows command-line tool.

The current version of CSVTest is Alpha 0.1. The following downloads are available:

  * Windows installation, consisting of executable, sample data and tutorial in CHM format.
  * Tutorial only in HTML format
  * Tarball of sources.

This Alpha version of the software is quite useable, but is currently lacking a manual. There is a reasonably extensive tutorial though, and the beginnings of a [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/csvtest/wiki/FAQ) here.  The purpose of this release is to gather comments and ideas for improvement - please post these at http://groups.google.com/group/csvtest.

CSVTest is intended to work alongside the [CSVfix](http://code.google.com/p/csvfix) stream editor.
